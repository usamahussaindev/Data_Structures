# C# Data Structures Examples

This repository contains examples of various data structures implemented in C#. Each data structure is demonstrated in a separate file, and this README provides an overview of each data structure along with usage instructions.

## Data Structures Included

### 1. LinkedList

- **File:** `LinkedListExample.cs`
- **Description:** Demonstrates the usage of a doubly linked list in C#. Includes adding elements to the list and iterating through it.

### 2. HashSet

- **File:** `HashSetExample.cs`
- **Description:** Demonstrates the usage of a HashSet in C#. Shows how to create a set of unique elements and perform basic operations like adding, removing, and checking for existence.

### 3. SortedSet

- **File:** `SortedSetExample.cs`
- **Description:** Demonstrates the usage of a SortedSet in C#. Illustrates how to create a sorted set of elements and the automatic sorting behavior.

### 4. BitArray

- **File:** `BitArrayExample.cs`
- **Description:** Demonstrates the usage of a BitArray in C#. Explains how to work with individual bits, making it useful for bitwise operations and compactly storing boolean values.

## Running the Examples

To run any of the data structure examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-data-structures-repo.git

2. Navigate to the directory of the specific data structure you want to run (e.g., `DataStructures`).

3. Compile and run the example using the C# compiler (e.g., `csc` or `dotnet`):

Replace `LinkedListExample.cs` with the filename of the data structure you want to run.
